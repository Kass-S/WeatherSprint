Build a weather app that is able to search for and retrieve weather information for a specific location has a favorites list, add that city to a list of favorites, and on each search, ability to see, current weather at the time of the search, a general 5 day forecast, and the ability to see max temp and min temp of the current day.

comments: The design is nicely done, I like the use of the openWeather icons to display the forecast. Although, the favorites list in not functional, I would refer to the createElements() function that we learned in the 1st local storage lecture in order to print the local stoarge on the page. The current day, week, and month is also not functional on my end, may be user error but there are getMonth() and getDay() methods to get those easily. Solid go at it thus far just a few additions to meet requirements
